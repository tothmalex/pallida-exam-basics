# EXAM: Programming Basics

### Getting Started
 - Fork this repository under your own account
 - Clone the forked repository to your computer
 - Create a `.gitignore` file so generated files won't be committed
 - Commit your progress frequently and with descriptive commit messages
 - All your answers and solutions should go in this repository

### What can I use?
- You can use any resource online, but **please work individually**
- **Don't just copy-paste** your answers and solutions, use your own words instead.
- **Don't push your work** to GitHub until your mentor announces that the time is up


# Tasks
## 1-3. Complete the following tasks: (~90 mins)
- [Uniques Characters](uniquechars/UniqueChars.java)

- The solution follows [styleguide](https://github.com/greenfox-academy/teaching-materials/blob/master/styleguide/java.md) [1p]
- Has proper error handling where the specification says it [1p each]
- Has the correct loops, methods, filters [1p each]
- The code is clean, without unnecessary repetition, and with descriptive names [1p each]
- You commit frequently with descriptive commit messages [1p]

## 4. Question time! (~10 mins) [4p]

###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
[There are some major differences which are listed below:
 Meanwhile functions can be defined outside of the class, methods must be defined within a class.
 Functions could be defined in any structured languages but methods are present in object oriented languages like Java.
 Another difference is that functions could be called independently, which is not true in the case of methods where an object or an instance is needed to call it.]

### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:
[A constructor in Java is a code which is applied when an object is created since it is main purpose is to create an instance of a class.
 It might be compared to methods but there several distinctions such as constructor is called automatically when an object is created,
 the name of the constructor has an identical name as of the class, constructors do not own such properties as return type. Finally
 we do not regard constructors as part of the class not like we do with methods.]
